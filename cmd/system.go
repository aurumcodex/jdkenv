	Use:   "system",
	Short: "Set usage of system installed JDK",
	Long: `Searches for a JDK implementation that was installed via a
package manager on your operating system. Default searches /usr/lib64/ for
an "openjdk-*" directory or similar. Can be set in a toml file called "system.toml"
if your package manager does not install directly to /usr/lib64 (or /usr/lib32 if using a multilib version)`,

		util.CheckRuntime()

		fmt.Println("system called")
	},

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// systemCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// systemCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
	// correttoCmd.Flags().BoolP("8", "", false, "set JDK version to Java 8 (if installed via package manager)")
	// correttoCmd.Flags().BoolP("11", "", false, "set JDK version to Java 11 (if installed via package manager)")
