A simple Go program to manage and install (if not found) various JDKs.

Useful for when you use multiple JDK implementations, or want to build on different versions to test your
Java projects or other JVM language projects on different standard libraries.

Creates a directory `.jdkenv` in the `$HOME` directory, and will contain the downloaded JDK .tar.gz archives
fully extracted. Once a JDK has been selected, an `env` file will be created within the `.jdkenv` directory
that can then be sourced via a shell recfile. (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.profile`, etc.)

Takes quite a lot of inspiration from how JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA IDE can download and use various JDKs.
(Even the `.toml` files take quite a lot of inspiration from IntelliJ's `*.intellij` files for its known JDKs.)

NOTE: Environment variable setting not yet implemented.
